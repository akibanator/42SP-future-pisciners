I found that once a week (if I am not mistaken its on Friday), you will have to prove that you can program on your own. So, no internet, no mates, just you.
Here we have exercises that we based on **examshell** levels.

The exams goes by levels, starting from level 0. By doing each problem correctly, one level up, and so the difficulty of the problems. If one fails a problem, you can retry another problem in the same level, but without getting the full marks.

# Credits
Each level is designed by **Staff 42**.
